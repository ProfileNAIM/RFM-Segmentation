# RFM-Segmentation
RFM Segmentation sorts customers by **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary value** to reveal who’s most loyal and who’s drifting away. It’s like reading the heartbeat of your business—spotting VIPs, casual buyers, and sleepers—so you can target each group with smarter, personalized marketing.
